2018. Directed by Tamara Jenkins, Written by Tamara Jenkins. 
I give this movie PROPS. The plot was legitimately something I'd never seen before, had never even thought about before. It doesn't just play it for comedy either, it gets lots of real drama out of and comedy. The writing is really good. It's the best thing about it. The directing was adequate and got the writing through.
