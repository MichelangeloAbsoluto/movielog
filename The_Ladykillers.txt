Really funny and well shot movie. Less good than I remembered. Do the Coen brothers age well? I'm becoming less sure. Their shot grammar seems cartoonish and basic with less substance than I originally thought. This is a thought-in-motion. I don't know where it will end up. Regardless, they are truly good at what they do -- rhythmic shots, caricature shots, and running jokes. A caricature shot exaggerates a physical motion or body part. The General's cigarette smoking and swallowing are caricature shots. The portrait of the widow's deceased husband. The policeman's boots up on the desk too.
