1982. Directed by Werner Herzog, Written by Werner Herzog. 
Strange movie. The opening with Fitzcarraldo rowing up the opera house and running in was very promising. The next scene of Fitzcarraldo talking to the opera house owner was shot beautifully. The movie becomes less disciplined after that. The idea of man with an "ide√© fixe" is cool, but not enough to carry a whole movie. I guess the real thing to admire is Herzog actually moving a ship over a mountain. Given today's SFX though, I can't say I ever thought "Wow!"
