Directed by Jeremy Saulnier. Written by Jeremy Saulnier.
A hobo who craves revenge uses creative problem-solving to hurtle the societal barriers against hobos acting freely and carries out a revenge-murder. The director is very good at giving the minimal amount of information. He says as much in interviews about the film. The movie is interrupted action, plot-advancement, and character perseverance with minimal explaining or info-dumping. When the hobo listens to the rednecks listening to the voicemail... that is a memorable scene.
