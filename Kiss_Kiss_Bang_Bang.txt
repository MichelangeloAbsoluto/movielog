Fantastic movie. Delivers exactly what a movie should. Robert Downey Jr's constant smart-ass stream-of-conscious commentary works beautifully. It's the kind of thing they tried with Elliott Gould in The Long Goodbye but RDJ does it so much better. I think this is a truly masterful movie. Great dialogue, funny story, amazing acting. Something to re-watch and steal from.
