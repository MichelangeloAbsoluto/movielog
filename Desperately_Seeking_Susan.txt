1985. Directed by Susan Seidelman. Written by Leora Barish.
I could watch Rosanna Arquette do just about anything. The actual movie was pretty conceited and relied on a lot of "If you say so" moments. Madonna wasn't as interesting as you would think. But Rosanna Arquette. Oh boy. She was also in John Sayles "Baby It's You".
