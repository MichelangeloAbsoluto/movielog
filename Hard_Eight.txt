Fantastic movie. The scene where Sid picks up Reilly at the cafe is great dialogue. The cut from Reilly's story in the car to his pants catching on fire in line reminded me of the Bonnie Situation. The first montage of Sidney explaining how to play a casino for benefits and John C. Reilly doing it is really good. There is a great transition when they're in John's hotel room and Sidney says he's going to gamble and Reilly asks "Can I watch you?" 
1996. P.T. Anderson.
