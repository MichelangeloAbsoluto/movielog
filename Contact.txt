1997. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, Written by James Hart, Michael Goldenberg (Carl Sagan)
A great 90s sci-fi adventure film. Jodie Foster is incredible. She's got a rare type of likability I can't recall feeling for other actors. Certainly not other female actresses. I love the way Zemeckis blocks the choreography around his shots. He gets 2 or 3 perfectly framed and choreographed shots out of one shot. It's quite remarkable. The mirror scene is especially masterful, but now what I'm talking about it. You can see it when the jeep drives up to the satellite and Jodie Foster is running up the hill after them.   
Lesson: Get multiple shots out of a single shot-- have blocking and camera movement always end in a new shot. Eliminates need for cuts and makes scenes smooth.
