I re-watched this with Mickey. He was aghast by the violence of the movie. Lol. The acting in the movie is first-class-- Matt Damon does something besides blue collar boston wunderkind and Philip Seymour Hoffman is awesome as that guy we all know. Jude Law is good too. The acting was fantastic. The actual cinemtography and directing and writing was unremarkable. Or invisible. I never stopped to saw "Wow". One exception was the transition from the train to the jazz nightclub. Jude Law says "Spooky. Spoo-key-keykey-keykey" and it transitions to a cymbal going "keykey-keykey-keykey".
