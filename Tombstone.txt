1993. Directed by George Cosmatos, Written by Kevin Jarre.
Fantastic cast and camerawork that features them handsomely. A little cheesy at times. Every scene with the actress was almost unbelievable-- she just starts asking him "What do you want out of life?" out of the blue. The movie was very solid overall. Val Kilmer was awesome in it. I've seen actors try the nihilistic, even-toned genius before to bad effect, but Kilmer nailed it. "I'm your Huckleberry". Not much to steal off the top of my head. I'll rewatch this one though.
