2006. Ryan Fleck. Ryan Fleck & Anna Boden. 
Shot in an interesting handheld low-fi style. Ryan Gosling is awesome at first. His character gets lame as the movie progresses. 

I need to explain something about Ryan Fleck. It's most apparent in his character work in Mississippi Grind. 
Frankly put, he likes broken people. 
And he loves actors named "Ryan". 
I'm not sure what kind of perversion exactly this is, but it is bad.
