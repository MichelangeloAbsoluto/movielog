1994. Directed by PJ Hogan. Written by PJ Hogan. 
This movie falls into my category "Regional coming of age story". Coming of age stories are a great genre because it's different for every region. Napoleon Dynamite showed us something different from What's Eating Gilbert Grape from Good Will Hunting. And becoming a woman in Australia is even different. Toni Collette is very believable in this. It's not quite as a funny as I would have made it, but still solid.
