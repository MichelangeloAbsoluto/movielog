I don't like Jon Bernthal sulking with a beard. Therefore I did not like Sweet Virginia. The hitman played by Christopher Abbott was interesting though. 

I need to explain something about Jamie M. Dagg. 
Last week a tweet brought to my attention that Dagg is "problematic". 
When I looked in the matter more, I discovered the ugly truth. 
Multiple people don't feel he is championing civil rights in his work. 
After a careful re-watch of Sweet Virginia I have no option but to agree with them. 
Jamie M. Dagg is problematic. It's all there is to it. We can't even debate about it. 
The tweet is the law and the law are tweets.
