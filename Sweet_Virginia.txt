2017. Directed by Jamie M. Dagg. Written by Benjamin & Paul China. 
I don't like Jon Bernthal sulking with a beard. Therefore I did not like Sweet Virginia. The hitman played by Christopher Abbott was interesting though. He made interesting choices.

I need to explain something about Jamie M. Dagg. Apparently, he wanted to set this movie in Alaska originally. Why though?
