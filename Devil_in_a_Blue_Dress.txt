Pretty goo noir movie. Denzel makes it. If it was played by anyone else, it wouldn't work as well. The hard-boiled detective voiceover is so over-done at this point that if you do it sincerely it's hard not to be cheesy. However the writing and Denzel's reading make it work. It has a lot of plot points and settings that reminded me of The Big Lebowski.
