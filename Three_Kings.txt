1999. Directed by David O. Russell, Written by David O. Russell
The most recent movie to "blow me away". The film is a great a comedy-action with touching moments. What struck me though is the amount of experimental and artsy shit going on. Lots of handheld footage, overblown weirdly colored film, and lots of weaving steadicam shots. He uses "The Bonnie Situation" trick a lot (when Wahlberg is being tortured). This is the short of film I would want to make.  Definitely something to re-watch and steal. I re-watched Silver Linings Playbook a few days before watching this--- tons of weaving steadicam shots in that too. Need to take a closer look at that.
