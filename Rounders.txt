1998. Directed by John Dahl. Written by David Levien & Brian Koppelman.
Great movie movie. Total Gonzaga movie too. Seeing Malkovich eat an oreo through the door slit is a memorable moment. Damon does his Boston but collar genius act again, and Norton is the insufferable friend you can't give up on. The two follow the Mean Streets storyline .
Lesson: Once you've given a character a signature trait (Malkovich oreos), find a scene that emphasizes it (Malkovich opens door slit and you see him eat an oreo). Explain the trait later.
