2018. Directed by Jonah Hill, Written by Jonah Hill. 
Fun movie to watch. Not very deep or good. Ultimately the core group of people just aren't that likable or heart-breaking. For this kind of group coming-of-age movie you need people to deeply love or relate to the characters. Is this a regional coming-of-age? Yes. However, the movie doesn't have the details about the skateboarding world you would expect. There's nothing I remember wanting to steal from this movie. The nostalgia was nice. The characters names were Sunburn, Fuckshit, and Fourth Grade.
