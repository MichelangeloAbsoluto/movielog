Watched for the movie bracket. It was Liam's pick. Unsurprisingly. Gabe saw the bracket and immediately asked, "Did Liam pick Count of Monte Cristo"? It was an enjoyable early 2000s action-adventure movie. Striking how basic it is compared to something like Pirates of the Caribbean. Luis Guzman is good as the Sancho Panzo. The scene of the old man tunneling into the Count's prison cell is memorable.
