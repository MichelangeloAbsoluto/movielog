1940. Directed by Charlie Chaplin, Written by Charlie Chaplin. 
Funny. Do we have movies like this anymore? IN the model of Chaplin, Keaton, WC Fields, or Marx Brothers? A vehicle for an actor to walk around a world constructed in his sensibility? I guess Sandler movies are the closest thing we have but they're far from as good. Modern comedies seem to take pride in being realistic. Older comedies had a brand of absurdity flowing throughout the movie that was constantly thwarting the protagonist. Consequences hardly mattered. We understood the world reset after each gag, and after the movie.

This gave me a lot of ideas for Kyle Eschen. Is he best suited for this brand of comedy?
